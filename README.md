My configuration for Jenkins and Selenium environment.    Configuration contains:* Jenkins,* Jenkins Node,* Selenium Grid (hub and two Chrome nodes) for executing E2E tests.# InstallationIn order to start environment:1. Clone this repository using ``git clone https://github.com/miloszhoc/jenkins-env.git ``.2. Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose on your machine.3. cd into jenkins-env directory.4. run `` docker-compose up -d `` command.5. When containers are up open Jenkins' website.6. Register your account.7. To add new node go to: dashboard -> manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes and Clouds -> New Node.      ![nodes](./images/nodes.png)8. Set the node name and check "Permanent Agent" checkbox.   9. In next step define:* \# of executors,* Remote root directory (in my case it's ``/home/jenkins/jenk`` - you can change it in dockerfile)* Labels (in my case - docker)* Launch method - Launch agent via SSH* Host - 172.16.1.3 (you can change it in docker-compose)* Credentials - `` jenkins:jenkins_password `` (you can change it in dockerfile)* Host Key Verification Strategy - Non verifying Verification Strategy     ![nodes_config](./images/nodes_config_2.png)10. After you save configuration you should see new working node on the list.       ![node_list](./images/node_list.png)# Additional infoSelenium Hub is available under 4444 port. Jenkins is available under 8080 port.   If you want to see details about containers network addresses check docker-compose.yml file.   If you want to change credentials of Jenkins node container check Dockerfile.
