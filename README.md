My configuration for Jenkins and Selenium environment.    Configuration contains:* Jenkins,* Jenkins Node,* Selenium Grid (hub and two Chrome nodes including one for debugging) for executing E2E tests.# Installation - Jenkins NodeIn order to start environment:1. Clone this repository using ``git clone https://github.com/miloszhoc/jenkins-env.git ``.2. Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose on your machine.3. cd into jenkins-env directory.4. run `` docker-compose up -d `` command.5. When containers are up open Jenkins' website.6. Register your account.7. To add new node go to: dashboard -> manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes and Clouds -> New Node.      ![nodes](./images/nodes.png)8. Set the node name and check "Permanent Agent" checkbox.9. In next step define:* \# of executors,* Remote root directory (in my case it's ``/home/jenkins/jenk`` - you can change it in dockerfile)* Labels (in my case - docker)* Launch method - Launch agent via SSH* Host - 172.16.1.3 (you can change it in docker-compose)* Credentials - `` jenkins:jenkins_password `` (you can change it in dockerfile)* Host Key Verification Strategy - Non verifying Verification Strategy     ![nodes_config](./images/nodes_config_2.png)10. After you save configuration you should see new working node on the list.       ![node_list](./images/node_list.png)# Installation - Selenium GridAfter executing `` docker-compose up -d `` selenium nodes should automatically connect to hub.![selenium_nodes](./images/selenium_nodes.png)# Additional infoSelenium Hub is available on 4444 port.    Jenkins is available on 8080 port.    You can connect to debug node using VNC viewer via 5900 port.    If you want to run e2e tests on debug grid node set "applicationName" capability to ``w2_debug``If you want to see details about containers network addresses check docker-compose.yml file.   If you want to change credentials of Jenkins node container check Dockerfile.
